# CompTIA A+ Learning Portfolio

## About Me
Hi, I'm [Tsion Andarge], a Computer Science student passionate about IT and cybersecurity. I’m currently working on the CompTIA A+ course to build a strong foundation in computer hardware, networking, and troubleshooting.

## Why This Portfolio
This repository serves as my learning journal for the **CompTIA A+** course. I’m documenting my journey through the course, including key notes, hands-on labs, and projects that I complete. It will be a place to showcase my growth and understanding of the material.

## Plan for Updates
I will keep this repository updated as I progress through the course. Each time I finish a module or complete a lab, I will upload notes and hands-on projects to continue building my portfolio. This will serve as a reference for my future career in IT.
